# Simulator
The program was developed to simulate a network using RAW with different groups. It can be simulated without using any form of grouping, with arbitrary (RAW) or pre-defined groups. In this way, we can use the groups created by recursive spectral clustering algorithm (R-SCRAW) to replace the arbitrary groups of RAW and observe the behavior of the network with this alternative formation.
